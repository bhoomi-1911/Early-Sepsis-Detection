# Early-Sepsis-Detection
This project aims to predict the onset of sepsis in ICU patients using clinical data such as vital signs, laboratory results, and demographic information. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the bodyâ€™s extreme response to infection, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes.
